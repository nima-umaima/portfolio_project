          <p>A marriage needs a good support system. The purpose of this ministry is to help couples establish a successful,
            fulfilling, joyous, lifelong marriage that brings glory to God and allows the couple to glorify God and enjoy
            Him and each other in their union. There is a gap that needs to be filled and The Blessed Hope Centre chooses
            to be proactive concerning the marriage enrichment/post marital programs. Blessed Hope Centre will roll out marriage enrichment workshops,
            holiday getaways, games, projects, dinners e.t.c that will improve the quality of marriages in the church whose themes will follow in the
            continuity of the pre-marital course outline. Marriage is the hub where God is raising the transformed generation.

          <p>
             Life is not meant to be lived alone. You were created to experience life with other people, and that’s why at BHC, we encourage you to
            get into a home fellowship groups- a group of three or more people who gather each week in a home, workplace to bring people together.
            We believe God created us to live in relationship with others and only then can we live the full life He intends for us.
            Sharing life through community is part of our design, but meaningful relationships aren’t always easy to find. That’s why home fellowship
            groups exist—to make these life-changing relationships relevant and accessible to you. In a home fellowship group you’ll hang out,
            study the Word, and pray together, a great way to grow deeper in your faith with those you enjoy being around.

          <p>A Place Where Kids Learn About Jesus on their Level. We are so passionate about kids learning about Jesus in a way they can understand.
          </p>
          <p>
             To raise up a godly generation of children who love, revere, trust and serve the Lord Jesus Christ holistically (Joyfully. Faithfully.
            Gloriously). We believe firmly that Jesus Christ is our Lord and Savior. We aim to train up the children to be grounded to this truth
            and to build their values and principles based on the word of God. Our desire is that the children discover their identity in Christ and grow to be confident,
            powerful disciples of Jesus Christ and to live out their purpose here on Earth. Our Mission: Teaching the word of God, instilling obedience and
            good morals in the lives of our children so that they can be the light in the world. Our Vision: Raising the next generation of Kingdom champions,
            to grow and develop to their maximum potential, teaching them who they are in Christ. Proverbs 22:6 (Amp) “Train up a child in the way he should go
            [and in keeping with his individual gift or bent], and when he is old he will not depart from it”
          </p>
          <p>
            We encourage parents of the BHC Kids to get acquainted with the teaching team and discuss the progress of their children and also exchange ideas and
            suggestions that will help grow the ministry.
